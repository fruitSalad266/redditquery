This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
The website is fully functional at [redditquery.vercel.app](https://redditquery.vercel.app).
The backend of this app can be found in the [jstest2 repo](https://github.com/fruitSalad266/jstest2).

## Local Hosting
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

By default, running with `npm run dev` will still access the [hosted api](https://jstest2.onrender.com) on Render. To test your own local backend, see [jstest2 repo](https://github.com/fruitSalad266/jstest2).

## Learn More
This project was created with [pushpull.io](http://api.pushpull.io), a third-party alternative to Reddit API.
This project was also deployed with the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).
